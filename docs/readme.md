# Additional Docs

The scigym is a prepackaged set of environments. Some external agents, environments, and miscellaneous not provided in this package are listed here. Environments not contained in this package, which fit the philosphy can be uploaded and displayed on our [webpage](https://scigym.ai). 

# Table of Contents

 - [Agents](agents.md) contains a listing of agents compatible with scigym environments. Agents facilitate the running of an algorithm against an environment.

 - [Environments](environments.md) lists more environments to run your algorithms against. These do not come prepackaged with the scigym. 
 
 - [Miscellaneous](misc.md) is a collection of other value-add tools and utilities. These could be anything from a small convenience lib to a collection of video tutorials or a new language binding.
